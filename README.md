# Cryptocurrencies


The goal is to see how they can potentially be grouped towards creating a classification for a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio. Given that there is no known output for the analysis, unsupervised learning is used to discover unknown patterns from the cryptocurrency data. The findings are displayed in scatter plots and tables.

**In order to analyze the data, the following steps occurred:**

  -Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
  
  -Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means
  
  -Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn
  
  -Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn
  
  -Create some plots and data tables to present your results
